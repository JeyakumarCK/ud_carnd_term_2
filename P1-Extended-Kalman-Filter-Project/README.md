This folder consists of C++ program files along with the data provided & Eigen library that are required to compile and run the program. It follows the instrcutions and rubrics given to the project, and can be compiled and built using cmake and make with the given cmake list file.

Visualization of the data is also tried with the given simulator and the python file.  Attached few pictures of the simulator running with my version of compiled C++ object.
